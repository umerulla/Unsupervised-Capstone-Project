# NETFLIX MOVIES AND TV SHOWS CLUSTERING

**Project Summary:**
Analyzing a Netflix dataset encompassing TV shows and movies up to 2019, sourced from the Flixable search engine. Notable findings include a threefold increase in TV shows since 2010 and a decrease of over 2,000 movie titles during the same period. The project involves extensive data visualization to extract key insights and preprocess textual data for clustering. The ultimate goal is to develop a recommender system utilizing cosine similarity, recommending the top 5 movies based on clustering results.
